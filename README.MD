## Scraping

<p>
This "project" is meant to house some of the scrapers I've built, for testing, for learning and similar purposes. <br>
Not really designed for scale/regular use, but I will add READMEs for understanding. <br>
Not recommeneded to use without checking every site's TOS.
</p>

The focus, at the moment, will be on basic Pythonic scraping and a bit less, on parsing.

### Scraping Course

Challenges from https://www.scrapingcourse.com shall be housed here. <br>
In my opinion, this looks like a very good sandbox to learn/polish scraping skills.

Another such sandbox is https://toscrape.com/ which is, not as challenging; I might attempt it sometime but have no such inclination atm.

### Aniscrapers

Broadly, intended to house any scrapers related to anime/manga etc. sites I have created.

### E-commerce

E-commerce data is one of the biggest practical use cases for web scraping. As such, I have made many scrapers for them of varying granularity. <br>

Those shall be housed here.
